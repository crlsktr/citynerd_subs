in a previous video i mentioned that
0:02
traffic congestion is not a linear
0:04
phenomenon every car you add to the
0:06
system imposes just a little more delay
0:09
on everyone else and each successive car
0:12
imposes a bit more delay than the last
0:14
one did i don't think this is intuitive
0:17
or well understood but it has or at
0:20
least it should have
0:21
huge policy implications so my hope is
0:24
by laying it all out here i can help
0:26
spread a little more understanding it's
0:28
all up next this is city nerd weekly
0:30
content on cities and transportation
0:33
usually a top 10 list but sometimes
0:36
delving into something a little more
0:37
theoretical and welcome to this week
0:41
first of all i'm going to start with a
0:42
kind of controversial assertion which is
0:45
that traffic congestion is bad and
0:49
trying to reduce it is actually a worthy
0:51
policy goal congestion wastes people's
0:54
time and here i really don't care about
0:56
single occupant vehicles but a lot of
0:59
buses get stuck in the same traffic
1:01
congestion consumes more energy it
1:04
creates unreliability and uncertainty it
1:07
delays emergency vehicles it means it
1:10
costs more to move goods through the
1:12
city and it tends to grow exponentially
1:15
as you add more traffic now there are
1:18
some really math heavy theoretical
1:20
arguments for why this is the case but i
1:23
wanted to put it in a context that's
1:25
more intuitive and relatable so i'm
1:28
going to give an example we're all
1:29
familiar with which is waiting at
1:31
traffic signals and there's still going
1:33
to be math in this but i think it's
1:35
going to be pretty straightforward so
1:37
here's the setup it's a typical weekday
1:39
and we're at the pm peak hour which
1:42
we're going to call 4 30 to 5 30 pm
1:45
we're at a really typical urban
1:47
signalized intersection with protected
1:49
left turns and left turn pockets and
1:52
we're looking at a particular movement
1:54
which is the eastbound left turn and
1:57
let's say the way the signal is
1:58
programmed the green time for this
2:00
movement never gets extended past 12
2:02
seconds because there are a lot of other
2:04
busy movements that need to get served
2:07
so that's six cars assuming a typical
2:10
saturation flow rate of a car every two
2:12
seconds in reality that can vary it's
2:15
less than six if there are people
2:18
on their phone not paying attention to
2:19
the signal or it could be more if the
2:22
driving is super aggressive but six is
2:25
gonna be a pretty typical traffic
2:27
engineering assumption now for that
2:28
eastbound left turn i've set up kind of
2:31
a generic demand profile for the hour
2:33
this isn't the one i'm gonna use for our
2:35
real world example but this generic
2:37
profile has a peak demand of five cars
2:40
per 120 second cycle at 5 pm and then
2:44
4.5 vehicles at the beginning and end of
2:48
the hour this is fairly typical in an
2:50
urban setting where the peak of the peak
2:52
is something like 10
2:54
higher than the minutes at the edge of
2:56
the peak hour but of course actual
2:59
observed traffic volumes are not regular
3:01
and predictable like this otherwise well
3:04
let's just say transportation planning
3:06
and traffic engineering would be way
3:08
easier with the generic profile only the
3:11
signal would operate fine because you'd
3:13
always have this smooth demand that runs
3:16
just under the capacity but
3:18
traffic isn't consistent instead it is
3:21
stochastic the traffic volume at any
3:24
given minute is random but generally
3:26
along kind of a normal distribution of
3:29
the average demand so i took my generic
3:31
profile and i applied a spreadsheet
3:34
function that generates a number that's
3:37
randomized along a normal distribution
3:39
for the average demand of each 120
3:43
second increment so what you get is a
3:45
set of 30 numbers one for each two
3:48
minute signal cycle that are random but
3:50
they center around that generic profile
3:53
and this is starting to look more like
3:55
what you'd see on an average day except
3:57
well they're fractions so of course
4:00
we're gonna round them but we're gonna
4:02
keep these raw fractional numbers in our
4:04
back pocket because they're gonna come
4:06
in handy later so you'll see i end up
4:08
with 150 cars during the hour which is a
4:12
tiny bit higher than the
4:13
142.5 that i expected but you know
4:17
random factors and rounding now remember
4:20
the capacity of this left turn is six
4:22
vehicles per 120 seconds so you can see
4:26
that there are eight vehicles over the
4:28
course of the hour that arrive in time
4:30
for a protected turn phase but six
4:33
vehicles have already arrived ahead of
4:35
them so they don't get served and they
4:37
have to wait another 120 second cycle
4:40
but it's actually worse than that each
4:42
of the eight vehicles spills into the
4:44
next cycle taking away some of the
4:46
capacity that was supposed to be
4:48
available for the vehicles that arrived
4:51
in the next two minutes so depending on
4:53
how much demand there was for the next
4:56
cycle you can potentially have a
4:58
cascading effect here so for this first
5:01
baseline scenario with 150 cars you get
5:04
seven additional cars that are displaced
5:08
so there are actually a total of 15 cars
5:10
that have to wait the additional 120
5:13
seconds right here you should already
5:14
start to realize that this is a
5:16
compounding problem so let's set up a
5:19
performance measure we're going to track
5:21
average delay which is probably the most
5:24
commonly used metric for signalized
5:26
intersection performance it's the basis
5:29
of level of service or loss so a few
5:32
assumptions let's say the average car
5:35
shows up halfway through the cycle and
5:37
if it gets served within that cycle
5:39
which most of them do in this baseline
5:41
scenario then those cars will average 60
5:44
seconds of signal delay or half to cycle
5:47
this is the way everyone hopes the
5:49
intersection operates and as long as you
5:51
can keep traffic conditions in the
5:54
uncongested regime you can really keep
5:56
adding cards without any additional
5:58
average delay so for example i can take
6:01
my randomized distribution and scale it
6:04
down until there's no congestion at all
6:07
this happens at about 120 vehicles and
6:10
in that case the average delay is 60
6:12
seconds no one is getting hit with an
6:14
extra cycle you really can't do better
6:16
than this but at 150 vehicles i've got
6:19
135 that are waiting just the 60 seconds
6:23
and i've got 15 that are waiting an
6:25
additional 120 seconds that's a total of
6:28
10 800 seconds divided by 150 vehicles
6:33
that's 72 seconds per vehicle and note
6:36
that eight of my 30 cycles are now right
6:38
at capacity and nine are over capacity
6:42
so odds are the next car that shows up
6:45
is probably going to have to weigh an
6:47
additional cycle okay so that's what the
6:49
left turn looks like when it's starting
6:51
to creep into a congested state now
6:53
let's add 10 vehicles i'm gonna scale up
6:56
my raw unrounded numbers until the
6:58
rounded distribution
7:00
adds up to 160. and this is what that
7:03
looks like 10 of my 32 second increments
7:07
now have an additional vehicle those
7:09
vehicles push other vehicles into
7:11
failure too so you should really start
7:14
to intuit that this is a domino effect
7:17
and it's gonna get progressively worse
7:19
every time i add 10 more cars this
7:21
vehicle that shows up at 440 is the
7:24
worst case it impacts the next four
7:26
cycles adding another 120 seconds of
7:29
delay for one vehicle in each of those
7:31
four cycles so the bottom line is i've
7:34
only added 10 vehicles that's 6.7
7:38
but my average delay goes from 72
7:40
seconds to 81 and that's a 12.5 increase
7:44
also where 17 of my 30 cycles were at or
7:48
over capacity when i had 150 vehicles
7:51
now 20 of the 30 cycles are which again
7:55
is increasing the probability that the
7:57
next car will hit a cycle that's already
8:00
maxed out i'm going to go through
8:02
additional scenarios and talk about
8:03
policy implications etc but first if
8:07
you're getting value out of this video
8:09
please pay your respects to the
8:10
algorithm and in general if you enjoy
8:13
nerdy explorations of transportation in
8:16
cities go ahead and subscribe if you
8:18
haven't already it's much appreciated
8:20
okay i won't get too far into the
8:22
details of the remaining scenarios
8:24
because it's the same story and it just
8:26
gets messier but here's what happens
8:29
at 170 vehicles the average delay is 98
8:32
seconds so we increased the original
8:35
volume of 150 by 13.3 percent but your
8:39
average delay is up 36
8:41
then at 180 vehicles your average delay
8:44
is 144 seconds so you've scaled your
8:48
traffic volume up 20
8:50
but you've increased the average delay
8:52
by a hundred percent you've doubled it
8:55
remember this is the same randomized
8:57
demand curve i started with i'm just
8:59
scaling it up and down the precise
9:01
percentages i'm citing will change if i
9:04
start with a different random number
9:05
seeding but the overall story is always
9:08
going to be the same this is exponential
9:10
growth and really by this point people
9:13
are starting to look at different routes
9:15
that avoid this left turn people are
9:17
taking the bus and biking or adjusting
9:20
their departure time or just not making
9:23
a trip at all and the city traffic
9:25
engineer is definitely getting phone
9:27
calls so a couple notes first despite
9:30
the way i characterized traffic dynamics
9:32
here there's really no such thing as
9:35
existing traffic that was minding its
9:37
own business and additional traffic
9:40
that's causing all the problems if
9:42
traffic is in a congested state then
9:45
every driver is really sharing equally
9:47
in the blame and the consequences as a
9:50
driver you perceive congestion as
9:52
something that's happening to you but
9:54
the reality is you are the congestion
9:57
second keep in mind this is very
9:58
simplified actual urban traffic is
10:01
dynamic and complex and congestion
10:03
manifests in a lot of ways for example
10:06
in a congested state that 12 second left
10:09
turn phase may not be able to
10:11
accommodate six vehicles you could have
10:14
spill back from a downstream bottleneck
10:16
that blocks the receiving lane you could
10:18
have excessive cueing in the through
10:21
lane that blocks the churn pocket so you
10:24
can't queue up six vehicles for the
10:26
phase and on the flip side the turn lane
10:28
itself can overflow and block the
10:31
through lane so these are all ways that
10:33
congested conditions reduce the actual
10:36
efficiency of the system so really what
10:39
i've presented here is kind of an
10:41
optimistic scenario so the point i hope
10:43
i've driven home here is not only do
10:46
more cars mean more congestion each
10:48
additional car means exponentially more
10:51
congestion which is bad for everyone so
10:54
what's the solution for some people
10:56
usually the people who are in charge of
10:58
policy and funding what this all
11:00
suggests is you really need to build
11:03
roads and intersections as big as
11:05
possible so you never reach the
11:07
congested state you can go to pretty
11:09
much any us state and see this approach
11:12
in action and decide for yourself if it
11:14
actually works or not another approach
11:17
is to make sure that the alternatives to
11:19
driving are abundant and competitive so
11:22
that when you do start tipping over into
11:24
hyper congestion people have the freedom
11:27
to make other choices or and hear me out
11:31
congestion pricing get people to pay for
11:33
the privilege of driving on an efficient
11:36
reliable uncongested network and invest
11:40
the proceeds in transit and active
11:42
transportation i made that sound simple
11:44
there's a lot to get into there and i'll
11:46
probably do that in a future video but
11:48
feel free to let me know your thoughts
11:50
on congestion pricing down in the
11:52
comments below and that's all i've got
11:55
for today keep the great comments and
11:57
viewer suggestions coming they really do
11:59
make this a better channel thanks for
12:00
joining and i'll be back with a new
12:02
topic next week see you then
